A competitor could get assistance to re-launch his kite only when the downed kite is out of the competition area. (Example when the kite drifts to the shore break).<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">In the event, if a competitor loses his kite from equipment failure, the competitor will be allowed to replace his kite during the heat only outside of the competition area. 12)The competitor has to get out from the competition area by his\/her own means.

Go as hard and high as possible. The height in combination with extreme moves is priority, but we will also take the horizontal distance travelled in account, combined with certain powered moves<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">40% Extremity. Controlled extreme high moves. Think about extremely powered and\/or extremely technical, or ultimately a combination of this as long as it is performed on a proper height<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<li class=\"\">No limitation in maximum number of moves\/combinations attempts per heat (including crashes) or repetitions for the same jump. \u2013 Only the 3 best tricks of the whole performance will be counted and will form part of the final result.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Variety within your best 3 moves is a key-factor, as focus is to prize the most complete \u201cExtreme Big Air\u201d rider.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">A 4th score (unique score) for overall impression of the entire performance will be given at the end of the heat, this score will be determined by considering a combination of different factors as: technical difficulty \/ style \/ variety \/ execution \/ risk \/ show \/ innovation, this will be added to the total score (could make the difference)<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">The average of these 4 scores that weigh evenly will be the final score.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Tied competitors\u2019 heat scores shall be broken in favour of the competitor with the highest single score. If the tie remains then it must be broken in favour of the 2nd highest score. In case the tie still remains it shall be broken in favour of the rider who has the higher score of Overall Impression.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Explanation of certain judging terms and criteria: The heats during the competition will be judged on the quality of the execution of each individual move, where the judges score every single move, but only the 3 highest scoring moves from a different trick category will count towards the final score next to the overall impression score. Hereby an explanation of some of the terms&gt;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li class=\"\">Grabs. A grabbed trick will be rewarded with a higher score than a non-grabbed trick on the Technical Difficulty criteria. However, the final score of each trick is directly related to the quality of the execution.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Power. The power during the execution of the tricks. Power will be considered as a combination of: a) Speed into and out of the tricks. b) Angle of the kite during the execution of the trick. (example: kite lower as the rider during a loop) c) Height and amplitude of the trick.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Risk factor is directly linked to the Power (already includes speed in and out, lines direction and amplitude \u2013 height) involved in the execution of the tricks, but also to the commitment of the competitor, technical and physical challenge during the execution, duration of the critical moment, amount and quality (lines direction) of the air in the trick, and energy on the execution.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Variety. The variety of the best 3 tricks completed during the heat is considered for the final overall impression score.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Height. Height of the trick completed during the heat. This aspect will exponentially come into consideration as the wind conditions increase, but only when the height is achieved along risk factor and technical difficulty.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Smoothness. Smoothness and fluidity during the execution of tricks completed during the heat, between different tricks in a combo and on landings.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Style. The personal flamboyance and attitude of the competitor when executing a trick.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">Innovation. Tricks that have never been landed in competition before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"\"><b class=\"\">OTHER JUDGING ASPECTS<\/b><\/p>\n<ol class=\"\">\n<li class=\"\">Any handle pass that is finished by pulling the leash to get the bar, will be considered a crash.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">The chicken loop is considered as part of the bar. Grabbing the chicken loop\u00a0when passing the bar still gives credit to the trick, although, won\u2019t be considered as a clear pass.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">If a competitor \u201cbutt checks\u201d when landing the trick, but keeps momentum and has the board touching the water first followed by the \u2018butt\u2019, the judges can still give credit to the trick. (It\u2019s a crash if the competitors\u2019 first land on their back and the board is completely out of the water and then ride on) It\u2019s at the discretion of the head judge to consider if it\u2019s a crash or a butt check, this also depends on the extremity of the trick and the speed at landing. Each judge will consider how much credit he\/she will give to the trick. The credit given to a \u2018butt check\u2019 landing is directly related to the RISK FACTOR involved in the execution of the trick. For tricks with a high degree of risk factor judges won\u2019t deduct (much) points for a butt check.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">If a competitor lands a trick but did not control the kite throughout the execution of the trick resulting in the release of the handle bar and\/or the crashing of the kite into water after landing the trick, the trick will be considered as a crash.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"\"><b class=\"\">START, FINISH, TRANSITIONS<\/b><\/p>\n<ol class=\"\">\n<li class=\"\">FLAGS \u2013 Flag sequence for the heats will be explained at the riders meeting and posted on the Official Notice Board<\/li>\n<li class=\"\">HEAT AND TRANSITION DURATION \u2013 Heat and Transition Duration shall be posted at least 15 minutes before the heat in question on the Official Notice Board<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"\"><b class=\"\">DISCREPANCIES<\/b><\/p>\n<ol class=\"\">\n<li class=\"\">RE-RUNNING OF HEATS: The Head Judge has the power to re-run a heat, only when he has witnessed the complete heat and he firmly believes there is a major discrepancy in the judging scores from each individual judge.
